# Rain World Wallpaper Mode - V2.0 Development Status

## Current Blocker

### Issue: ProcessManager.Process Type Not Accessible

**Problem**:
- `ProcessManager.Process` is not a public type we can inherit from
- We need to research the actual base class for Rain World processes

**Error**:
```
error CS0426: The type name 'Process' does not exist in the type 'ProcessManager'
```

### Solution Options:

#### Option A: Use MainLoopProcess (Most Likely)
Rain World likely uses `MainLoopProcess` as the base class. Need to:
1. Research actual type name
2. Update WallpaperProcess to inherit from correct base
3. May need to decompile Assembly-CSharp.dll to find it

#### Option B: Hook Existing Process
Instead of creating custom process:
1. Hook into existing RainWorldGame
2. Modify it to behave like wallpaper mode
3. Simpler but less clean

#### Option C: Simplified Approach (RECOMMENDED FOR NOW)
Go back to enhanced F9 toggle with V2 features:
1. Keep V1.0 F9 toggle
2. Add new V2.0 HUD (auto-hiding)
3. Add Region Manager
4. Add Remix config
5. **Then** add menu button in V2.1

### Recommended Next Steps:

**IMMEDIATE** (Today):
1. Simplify V2.0 to work with existing F9 system
2. Integrate new HUD and RegionManager
3. Test working prototype

**SHORT-TERM** (This Week):
1. Research ProcessManager types properly
2. Find working menu mod examples
3. Study decompiled code

**LONG-TERM** (Next Week):
1. Implement proper menu integration
2. Release V2.0 with menu
3. Add full configuration

## What We Have Built (Ready to Use)

### ✅ Complete & Ready:
- RegionManager.cs (150 lines) - All 20 regions, shuffling, queue system
- WallpaperHUD.cs (230 lines) - Auto-hiding, mouse tracking, fade animations
- MenuIntegration.cs (110 lines) - Menu hooks (needs type fixes)

### ❌ Blocked:
- WallpaperProcess.cs - Can't compile without correct base class
- Full menu button - Depends on WallpaperProcess

## Pragmatic Path Forward

### V2.0-ALPHA (This Session)
**Goal**: Get V2 features working with F9 toggle

**Changes**:
1. Keep existing toggle system
2. Replace old HUD with new WallpaperHUD
3. Integrate RegionManager
4. Test auto-hiding HUD
5. Test mouse detection
6. Test region switching

**Deliverable**: Functional V2.0 features without menu button

### V2.0-BETA (After Research)
**Goal**: Add menu integration properly

**Requirements**:
1. Decompile Rain World to find exact types
2. Study working menu mods
3. Implement proper ProcessManager integration
4. Add menu button

**Deliverable**: Complete V2.0 with menu

### V2.1 (Configuration)
**Goal**: Full Remix configuration

**Features**:
- All timing sliders
- HUD options
- Region selection
- Visual customization

## Current File Status

### Working Files:
- ✅ RegionManager.cs
- ✅ WallpaperHUD.cs
- ✅ WallpaperMod.cs (V1.0 base)

### Needs Fixes:
- ❌ WallpaperProcess.cs (type errors)
- ❌ MenuIntegration.cs (depends on WallpaperProcess)

### Not Started:
- WallpaperConfig.cs (Remix integration)

## Decision Point

### Path A: Merge V2 Features into V1 Now ✅ RECOMMENDED
**Time**: 30 minutes
**Risk**: Low
**Result**: Working V2 features today

**Steps**:
1. Add RegionManager to WallpaperMod.cs
2. Replace old HUD with WallpaperHUD
3. Test everything
4. Ship V2.0-alpha

**Pros**:
- Get new features working immediately
- Test HUD and region system
- Users can try it today

**Cons**:
- Still F9 toggle (but that's fine for now)
- Menu button comes later

### Path B: Research First, Then Implement
**Time**: 2-4 hours
**Risk**: Medium
**Result**: Might still fail if types are inaccessible

**Steps**:
1. Decompile Rain World
2. Find correct types
3. Fix WallpaperProcess
4. Fix MenuIntegration
5. Test

**Pros**:
- "Proper" implementation
- Menu button in V2.0

**Cons**:
- Time consuming
- Might hit more blockers
- Delays testing new features

## My Recommendation

**Choose Path A**: Merge V2 features into V1 toggle system NOW.

**Why**:
1. Gets features working today
2. Lets us test HUD and regions
3. Menu button can be V2.1
4. Pragmatic and low-risk

**Then**:
- Release V2.0-alpha with F9 toggle
- Research menu integration properly
- Release V2.1 with menu button

## User Impact

### With Path A (V2.0-alpha):
- ✅ Auto-hiding HUD
- ✅ Mouse detection
- ✅ All 20 regions
- ✅ Smart region switching
- ✅ Progress tracking
- ⏳ Menu button (V2.1)
- ⏳ Remix config (V2.1)

### With Path B (if successful):
- ✅ Everything above
- ✅ Menu button
- ❌ Delayed release
- ❌ Untested features

## What Should We Do?

**Your call**:

A) Merge V2 features now, menu later
B) Research types, try to fix menu integration

I recommend A for practical reasons.

**Current Status**: Awaiting decision
**Blocker**: ProcessManager type access
**Solution**: Simplify or research deeper
