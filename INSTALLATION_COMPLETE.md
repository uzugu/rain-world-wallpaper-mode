# Rain World Wallpaper Mod - Installation Complete! 🎉

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Research & Planning
- Studied Rain World modding framework (BepInEx)
- Analyzed Safari mode mechanics
- Designed wallpaper system architecture

### 2. Mod Development
- Created full BepInEx plugin structure
- Implemented room selection with smart history tracking
- Added smooth cubic easing for camera transitions
- Implemented memory management (room realization/abstractization)
- Built complete mod source code (230+ lines)

### 3. Build & Installation
- Copied required DLLs from Rain World installation
- Successfully built the mod with .NET SDK
- Installed mod to Rain World's mods folder

## 📍 Installation Location

The mod is now installed at:
```
E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Rain World\RainWorld_Data\StreamingAssets\mods\vrmakes.wallpapermod\
├── modinfo.json
└── plugins/
    └── RainWorldWallpaperMod.dll
```

## 🎮 How to Test

1. **Launch Rain World**
   - Start the game normally through Steam

2. **Enable the Mod**
   - Go to main menu → Remix → Mod Management
   - Find "Rain World Wallpaper Mode" in the list
   - Enable it and restart the game if prompted

3. **Start Observing**
   - Start any campaign or Safari mode
   - The mod will automatically begin transitioning between rooms
   - Default settings:
     - **Stay Duration**: 30 seconds per location
     - **Transition Duration**: 5 seconds smooth easing
     - **History**: Avoids last 10 visited rooms

## 🎛️ How It Works

- **Automatic**: No input needed, just watch the world
- **Smart Selection**: Randomly picks rooms, avoids repeating recent ones
- **Smooth Motion**: Cubic ease-in-out for cinematic transitions
- **Memory Efficient**: Unloads old rooms automatically
- **Region Aware**: Works with any loaded region

## ⚙️ Current Configuration

Timings are hardcoded in `WallpaperMod.cs`:
```csharp
transitionDuration = 5f;   // Time to transition between rooms
stayDuration = 30f;        // Time at each location
MAX_HISTORY = 10;          // Rooms to remember
```

To change these, edit the values in the source code and rebuild.

## 🔧 Modifying the Mod

### Source Code Location
```
C:\Users\uzuik\Documents\VRmakes\Projects\RainWorldWallpaperMod\
```

### To Rebuild After Changes
```bash
cd "C:\Users\uzuik\Documents\VRmakes\Projects\RainWorldWallpaperMod"
"C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe" build -c Debug
```

### To Reinstall After Rebuild
```bash
cp bin/Debug/net48/RainWorldWallpaperMod.dll "E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Rain World\RainWorld_Data\StreamingAssets\mods\vrmakes.wallpapermod/plugins/"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Mod doesn't appear in Remix menu
- Check that `modinfo.json` is in the mod folder
- Verify the `plugins` subfolder exists
- Restart Rain World

### Game crashes on startup
- Check BepInEx console for errors
- Located at: `Rain World/BepInEx/LogOutput.log`
- Look for lines containing "WallpaperMod"

### Transitions not working
- Make sure you're in-game (not in menus)
- Check that a world is loaded
- Verify the mod is enabled in Remix

### Camera doesn't move
- Ensure you're not controlling a creature
- Check console logs for "Starting transition" messages
- Try different game modes

## 📋 Known Limitations

1. **Single Region Only**: Currently only transitions within the active region
2. **No Config UI**: Settings must be changed in code
3. **Basic Filtering**: Only filters out karma gates
4. **No Visual Effects**: Plain transitions, no fading

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

See `DESIGN.md` for comprehensive feature wishlist:
- Multi-region world traversal
- Configuration UI in Remix
- Fade transitions
- Creature following mode
- Music synchronization
- Custom region paths
