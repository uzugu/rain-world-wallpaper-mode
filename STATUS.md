# Rain World Wallpaper Mod - Development Status

## Project Location
`C:\Users\uzuik\Documents\VRmakes\Projects\RainWorldWallpaperMod`

## Completed Tasks ✓

### Phase 1: Research & Planning
- [x] **Researched Rain World mod framework**
  - Uses BepInEx for modding
  - Targets .NET Framework 4.8
  - Modern version (1.9+/Downpour) uses Remix system

- [x] **Studied Safari mode**
  - Observer/spectator mode with Overseer control
  - Room teleportation mechanics
  - Originally designed as "screensaver" mode - perfect inspiration!

- [x] **Created project structure**
  - BepInEx plugin template
  - .csproj configuration
  - modinfo.json metadata
  - README and documentation

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [x] **Room selection system**
  - Randomly selects rooms from current world
  - Tracks room history to avoid repetition (10 room history)
  - Filters out karma gates
  - Falls back intelligently when all rooms visited

- [x] **Smooth camera transitions**
  - Cubic ease-in-out function for natural movement
  - Vector2 position interpolation
  - Configurable transition duration (default: 5 seconds)
  - Configurable stay duration (default: 30 seconds)

- [x] **Room management**
  - Realizes rooms when needed
  - Abstractizes old rooms to save memory
  - Uses MoveCamera() for proper room switching

- [x] **Hooks implemented**
  - `RainWorld.OnModsInit` - Initialization
  - `RainWorldGame.Update` - Main update loop
  - `RoomCamera.Update` - Camera control

## Current Implementation Details

### Key Features
1. **Automatic Random Exploration**: Mod automatically explores rooms without user input
2. **Smart Room Selection**: Avoids recently visited rooms and karma gates
3. **Smooth Transitions**: Cubic easing creates cinematic camera movement
4. **Memory Management**: Old rooms are abstractized to prevent memory issues
5. **Multiple Camera Positions**: Randomly selects from available camera angles per room

### Configuration Options
```csharp
transitionDuration = 5f;   // Seconds to transition between rooms
stayDuration = 30f;        // Seconds to view each location
MAX_HISTORY = 10;          // Number of rooms to remember
```

## Remaining Tasks

### Phase 3: World Traversal (Optional Enhancement)
- [ ] **Multi-region support**
  - Detect when current region exhausted
  - Select adjacent regions
  - Handle world reloading for region changes
  - Implement fade transitions for region switches

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish
- [ ] **Required for testing:**
  - Copy Rain World DLLs to `lib/` folder:
    - `UnityEngine.dll` from `RainWorld_Data/Managed/`
    - `Assembly-CSharp.dll` from `RainWorld_Data/Managed/`
    - `HOOKS-Assembly-CSharp.dll` from `BepInEx/plugins/`

- [ ] **Build the mod:**
  ```bash
  dotnet build
  ```

- [ ] **Install and test:**
  - Copy from `artifacts/bin/RainWorldWallpaperMod/debug_win-x86/mod/`
  - To `RainWorld_Data/StreamingAssets/mods/`
  - Enable in Remix menu

- [ ] **Testing checklist:**
  - Verify mod loads without errors
  - Check room transitions work smoothly
  - Confirm easing looks natural
  - Test memory usage over extended runtime
  - Verify no crashes during transitions
  - Test with different regions

- [ ] **Polish:**
  - Add configuration UI (optional)
  - Handle edge cases (empty regions, etc.)
  - Optimize performance
  - Add visual fade effects (optional)

## Next Steps to Test

1. **Locate Rain World installation**
   - Find where Rain World is installed on your system

2. **Copy required DLLs**
   ```bash
   # From Rain World installation folder:
   cp RainWorld_Data/Managed/UnityEngine.dll lib/
   cp RainWorld_Data/Managed/Assembly-CSharp.dll lib/
   cp BepInEx/plugins/HOOKS-Assembly-CSharp.dll lib/
   ```

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\uzuik\Documents\VRmakes\Projects\RainWorldWallpaperMod"
   dotnet build
   ```

4. **Install the mod**
   - Copy the `mod` folder from artifacts to Rain World's mods folder
   - Launch Rain World
   - Enable "Rain World Wallpaper Mode" in Remix menu

5. **Test in-game**
   - Start any campaign or Safari mode
   - Observe automatic room transitions
   - Check console for any errors

## Known Limitations

1. **Single Region**: Currently only explores rooms in the active region
2. **No Player Override**: Doesn't disable player input (may interfere)
3. **No Visual Effects**: No fading or special effects during transitions
4. **Basic Config**: Configuration requires code changes, no UI

## Future Enhancements

See DESIGN.md for comprehensive list of future features including:
- Music synchronization
- Creature following mode
- Multi-region world traversal
- Weather effects
- Time-of-day cycles
- Multi-monitor support
